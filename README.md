A React Redux CRUD app that consumes data from an API
=====================================================

This app demonstrates some of the core Redux concepts such as...
* Presentational vs. Container Components
* The Redux store
* Redux Thunk and using middleware when creating stores
* Reducer functions
* Action creator functions
* Dispatching actions and making API calls

I'm still new to Rails so I will likely use Node until I'm more familiar with Ruby.
